## Introduction
Hello! As we all know if you're a content creator in this modern day it can be hard to gain views and traffic
to your content as well as keeping up on the ever-changing trends of the digital universe. You could spend
hours to days researching on what is currently trending today and what type of keywords and hashtags would
bring traffic to your content, until today! If this is your problem, VideoDashboard is your solution.

## What is VideoDashboard?
VideoDashboard is a program which leverages all the social media platforms and combines them into one
singular viewing plane for easy access on what is currently trending on social media. VideoDashboard
effectively allows you to automate content creation, as it comes with features such as ready-made video
templates based upon current trends in which you can customize so it is based around your own channel and
community, it also has Traffic Automation which publishes your video to over eleven of the hottest social
media platforms right now, including YouTube, TikTok, Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Reddit and so much
more! It's most useful and sought-after feature, however, is it's "Trending Market Pulse Finder" which
compiles literal millions of social media videos and posts in seconds which will then tell you what the
hottest trends are right now in the social media space.


### How does VideoDashboard work?
VideoDashboard works by using new unseen technologies to help leverage the trends on all social media
platforms and bring them into one, simple to understand plane which will help new and upcoming content
creators compete with the established players who have got whole SEO and Search Optimisation teams
behind them. VideoDashboard is for sure an exciting new program which, combined with its low price for
customers, will help boost those new content creators into the playing field and will give them the views and
subscribers that they sought after and deserve.
VideoDashboard is expected to launch at 3PM EST on the 11th of February where the programme will
become purchasable by everyone. Once again I urge you to check VideoDashboard out if your a new or
growing content creator if you really want that boost that will propel you into fame without having to
sacrifice thousands of dollars on advertising that will have terrible turn-outs.

## My Review of VideoDashboard
So far my experience with VideoDashboard has been excellent, the application was worth the money I
spent on it and has brought a lot of success to my Social Media outlets as promised. The features within the
program such as the Trending Market Pulse Finder and the various other means of content creation
automation has not only made getting my content out there a hundred times easier but has also made making 
the content itself easier and more affordable, knowing that my videos will be successful has made me more
energetic and proud in my work and has also freed up time for me to work on revision and overall has
released a massive burden from my shoulders! Thanks VideoDashboard !


### Pros and Cons
